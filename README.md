# Fixing the TERRIBLE Blog!!


By [Liam Buell](https://github.com/Lbuell/)

Modify the app to improve performance of page loads, without letting the user experience suffer (eg: one comment per page is fast, but clicking through them all is annoying).

Deploy your app to heroku. Use whatever techniques you can think of to make it fast. Think carefully (and/or read up) on how Heroku serves up your site to find ways to get faster.

Competition Guidelines:

    The blog must contain full posts on the index page
    All posts, comments, and replies must be accessible with a mouse (eg, there has to be a click path, they can't be left out)
    We are attempting to optimize usability, so pages with poor UX will be penalized: The more resources on the home page, the better
    You must deploy your site to Heroku
    Point loadimpact.com at your heroku url to see how well it does
    We will take the average of your best and worst load times ((Test min + Test max) / 2)
    Final score will be: (# of resources on the page) * (total Load Impact requests) / (average load time in ms)
    You must change your README: Include your score details, or a link to your LoadImpact results
